# python-api-challenge

WeatherPy.ipynb contains a Jupyter notebook that reads in data from the OpenWeatherMap api. It randomly generates cities, pulls information about their weather from the api, and stores the information in 'cities.csv'. Plots and linear regressions are created to visualize the weather data for the cities.

VacationPY,ipynb contains a Jupyter notebook that reads in the cities from cities.csv. It generates a list of cities where certain weather conditions are met, and then it generates a map that shows hotels in each of these cities.


To run: need to have Jupyter notebook, Python, and Anaconda installed. Also need to have api keys for OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify
